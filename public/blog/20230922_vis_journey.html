            <h2>At the beginning was a flicker</h2>
            <p>My journey as a <i>visualization enthusiast</i> began in high school, even before I fully understood the concept or the significance of data visualization. I was part of a team with four other students, and our project involved monitoring an autonomous sailing boat, referred to as the 'Alert Control System.' At that time, this was a pioneering venture in an era when autonomous driving was in its infancy, and autonomous sailing was yet to be conceived. Although this project had visualization aspects, our primary focus was on ensuring simplicity and user-friendliness. We faced numerous challenges, including:
            <ui>
                <li>Being high school students, we had limited experience with the available tools and lacked confidence in our abilities. As a result, even minor bugs often consumed a significant amount of time to resolve. To overcome this, we adopted a collaborative approach. We frequently engaged in pair programming sessions and held regular code review evenings to support one another in debugging and improving our skills."</li>
                <li>We encountered several challenges in the testing phase. Given the practical constraints, we couldn't have the ship physically in the water at all times. While the idea of coding at the beach sounds appealing, it wasn't feasible for a high school project. Jokes aside, our solution was to simulate real-time data.Given our primary focus on the user interface (UI), we made the assumption that if one alert triggered for a specific value, other alerts for different values would exhibit similar behavior.</li>
                <li>We undertook this project during our final year of high school, which meant not only juggling a demanding 40-hour school week but also preparing for our final exams.</li>
                <li>As a requirement, we were tasked with building this app in Java, despite lacking a deep understanding of UI/UX and having limited experience in user interface coding. The challenge magnifies when you're developing something beyond a simple command-line tool.</li>
            </ui></p>

                One of my primary responsibilities involved leading and guiding the team, with the invaluable support of a supervisor. This encompassed maintaining open lines of communication with stakeholders, generating comprehensive business reports, and ensuring that all aspects of the project remained on course (pun intended).

                I personally crafted paper prototypes for the user interface and developed the program's business logic. In this context, the business logic primarily pertained to the alarm system, determining the specific conditions under which an alert should be triggered and become visible in the frontend.
                
                For the frontend, we adhered to a principle of simplicity, presenting a straightforward list encompassing more than 400 sensor values for easy reference. Users could effortlessly customize their experience by employing drag-and-drop functionality to place essential information tiles within the primary workspace or <i>cockpit</i>. These tiles were designed to dynamically change color in accordance with individually set thresholds for each value.
                
                Alarm notifications were presented through two distinct means: first, by altering the color of the relevant tiles and values independently; second, by employing a configurable alarm sound that could be applied to a group of values.

            <h2>6 years of politics and diabetes</h2>
            <p>My academic journey in <i>Scientific Computing</i> was not heavily centered on visualizations. In fact, the most thrilling graphical representation I encountered, especially in the realm of optimization, was a logarithmically-scaled line chart.Throughout the early stages of my bachelor's degree, which primarily revolved around mathematical problem-solving and database management tools, the focus leaned heavily towards functionality. It was only later, in my first courses involving human interaction, that I began to explore a more holistic approach. In those initial encounters with human interaction studies, I discovered the profound impact that design and user experience can have. Prior to this, whether in my own projects or those led by my professors, the end-users were typically myself or my academic mentors. Thus, the driving force behind our efforts was functionality, often taking precedence over aesthetics or appearance."</p>

            <p>During my initial five semesters, I lacked practical experiences, primarily focusing on theoretical coursework. However, a pivotal turning point arrived during my studies of Front-End Development, where I delved into JavaScript, HTML, CSS (with a specific emphasis on d3.js), and Tableau. This was akin to opening a door to an entirely new world — a vibrant garden brimming with fruits I could never have comprehended. Perhaps it's an exaggeration, but it truly marked a profound departure from my previous academic pursuits.

                Tableau, in particular, emerged as a significant revelation. It became an indispensable tool for exploring data, not only during that course but also in many others, shaping my path forward. It was during this period that I made a pivotal decision—choosing my thesis supervisor. Little did I know then that this choice would catalyze a complete shift in my academic trajectory.
                <br>
                As I embarked on my bachelor's thesis, I found myself transitioning from <i>hardcore</i> algorithmic programming to a world of user experience, test design, and usability, with a fascinating foray into data science. Surprisingly, it was within the realms of my thesis that I first encountered the concept of data science, an area of study I was yet to explore.
                <br>
                My thesis centered on the development of an application that facilitated our <i>expert-in-the-loop</i> to identify distinct clusters within a test dataset of patients, discerning those who might have diabetes from those who did not. As part of my user tests, I devised a unique approach using cookies and ingredients. Users could cluster cookies based on the ingredients available in their cupboard, but ultimately, we sticked to the more sophisticated expert findings.
                
                Not only did this journey expand my horizons, but it also led to the publication of my tool (accessible at <a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0043-5'>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0043-5</a>). It was an experience that transformed my academic and professional trajectory, merging the worlds of algorithmic programming, data science, and the rich tapestry of user experience and usability. </p>

            <p>Throughout my master's program in <i>Data Science</i> , I made a conscious effort to infuse each course with elements of data exploration, leveraging tools like Tableau and JavaScript. This addition wasn't just a preference; it was an essential selling point in the context of the curriculum. In particular, when we delved into the realms of supervised and unsupervised learning, I discovered a multitude of creative ways to visualize complex concepts, such as K-means clustering or decision trees.

                <br>
                However, it was during this academic journey that I encountered R, and more significantly, RMarkdown. This discovery prompted a transformative shift in my primary programming language. I was immediately drawn into the rich ecosystem of the tidyverse, immersing myself in data manipulation and visualization. The combination of R and RMarkdown presented a dynamic duo, streamlining the process of creating reproducible and interactive reports.
                <br>
                To add the final layer to this multidimensional journey, I ventured into Shiny. This framework represented the pinnacle of my exploration, allowing me to create web applications that not only showcased my data-driven insights but also provided a means for interactive engagement with the data. It was a captivating journey that further solidified my passion for data science and its multifaceted applications. </p>

            <p>During my two years pursuing my master's degree, I embarked on the journey of building various data tools, each of which contributed to my growing expertise and understanding. Before delving into the details of my master's thesis project, I'd like to briefly touch upon a few of these projects.
                
                My journey commenced with the creation of a Shiny app, designed to process data from a gyroscope sensor embedded in smartphones. This innovative tool offered insights into the user's physical activities, distinguishing between walking, running, or commuting in the subway. Using clustering techniques, I successfully categorized various types of transportation and even discerned unique walking patterns. To be candid, I found the process of building this tool more exhilarating than the actual analysis, yet the tool served as a valuable asset for subsequent data exploration. It reinforced my belief that a powerful tool can significantly expedite the discovery of valuable insights.In one of my courses, I encountered a straightforward exercise involving the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. However, I decided to take it a step further and developed an application that facilitated the comparison of four different implementations: three of my own in R and Rcpp and one built using an alternative language. This endeavor was enlightening as it demonstrated that, even within the same language, it's possible to craft both highly inefficient and efficient code. 
                <br> My master's thesis marked a significant turning point as I entered the realm of textual data, specifically sentiment analysis. Here, I embarked on the creation of my first full-stack data tool in R, with a noteworthy side note that the sentiment classification was carried out independently of my thesis. The tool I developed provided journalists and interested users with the means to explore topics and sentiments related to different politicians or political parties. This endeavor proved to be both educational and enjoyable, allowing me to master the art of working with textual data and constructing user interfaces in R. An early version of this tool may still be accessible today on<a href=" https://domb.shinyapps.io/sitzplan_grid/">shinyapps.io</a>)).</p>

                Within this role, I had the unique opportunity to pioneer the introduction of advanced reporting techniques tailored for managers. While they were familiar with spreadsheets and adept at utilizing them, the exponential growth in data became a hindrance to their productivity. This realization prompted me to shift the focus toward dashboards and visualizations, streamlining the process of data analysis and decision-making.
                <br>

                Over the years, I spearheaded numerous custom dashboard projects, each with its own set of challenges and successes. Among these projects, I take particular pride in mentioning the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        My inaugural significant project revolved around optimizing the reporting process for our chain of stores. Each manager oversaw multiple stores, each of which required frequent assessments of various key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure quality customer satisfaction and operational excellence.
                        <br>

                        In this endeavor, I placed significant emphasis on the creation of a user-friendly front-end interface. This interface was designed to present all the vital metrics and data from every store, offering a comprehensive overview to the respective manager. It not only provided a snapshot of each store's performance but also facilitated a deep dive into granular details. Users could easily access information such as year-long performance trends and comparisons with similar stores. This initiative aimed to streamline the decision-making process and empower managers with valuable insights to drive improvements across their store portfolio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a crucial component of an end-to-end framework dedicated to visual data analysis and model development, I undertook the construction of a dynamic Shiny application. This application was designed to facilitate the in-depth exploration of tabular data, offering a comprehensive suite of analytical tools.
                        <br>
                        Each column of the dataset underwent a meticulous examination, wherein common statistical measures such as mean, median, and skewness were calculated and presented. Additionally, each column was subjected to assessments of similarity to predefined distributions. For example, it could determine whether an 'age' column followed a binomial distribution or another specified distribution. This wealth of statistical information was thoughtfully aggregated onto a single page, ensuring that even complex insights were presented in easy-to-understand visualizations.
                        <br>
                        The application featured a second layer, enabling users to generate tree models and gain insights into the model's structure and performance. This layer provided a visual representation of the decision tree and offered a confusion matrix, crucial for understanding the model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, users had the flexibility to experiment with the response variable's nature, toggling between binary and non-binary labels.
                        <br>
                        The third layer of the application was dedicated to stability assessment, examining both model and feature stability over time or with respect to seasonal variations. This comprehensive toolset aimed to empower users with the ability to delve deep into data analysis and model development, ensuring informed and data-driven decision-making throughout the process.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                I had the privilege of being a guiding light for many, helping them navigate the intricate landscape of their data. In the numerous meetings and collaborative workgroups that I found myself in, I passionately championed the idea that the most potent approach to any data challenge was to harness the transformative potential of data visualization.
                <br>
                In these moments, I witnessed firsthand the incredible power of visualization - it was like unlocking a new dimension in understanding. It wasn't about merely staring at static tables and lifeless statistics. No, it was about breathing life into the data, revealing its hidden stories and insights through the language of visuals.
                <br>
                
                Each time, I was driven by a simple yet profound belief: 'a picture says more than a thousand words.' This was the catalyst for innovation and the spark that ignited transformative change. I was motivated by the knowledge that a well-crafted visualization could not only simplify complex concepts but could also inspire action, enabling data-driven decisions to shine as beacons of progress.
                <br>
                My mission was to empower individuals to see beyond the numbers, to embrace the vivid narratives woven into the data, and to fuel their curiosity. These moments were filled with the electrifying feeling of turning data into insights, unlocking potential, and sparking the enthusiasm needed to surmount even the most formidable data challenges. With every project, I was reminded that data visualization wasn't just a tool; it was a gateway to uncovering the extraordinary within the ordinary and sparking a collective motivation to explore the limitless possibilities hidden within the world of data.
